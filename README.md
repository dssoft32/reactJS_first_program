# React Features

**JSX - JSX** is JavaScript syntax extension. It isn't necessary to use JSX in React development, but it is recommended. **Components -** React is all about components. You need to think of everything as a component. This will help you to maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.

*   It re-renders on every update.
*   It is fast and open source.
*   React can be used on client as well as server side.

### Requirements:-

*   Node js Platform
*   React liabraries(react.js and react-dom.js)
*   webpack
*   babel and babel plugins
*   ES6

### Instructions for running the project :-

After downloading and extracting the zip , open **terminal/command** prompt and go to the folder directory.  

Now type "**npm start**" command. Be patient, as webpack bundled takes little time to get packed all files. Once webpack bundled gets completed, the server will run on the port defined in **webpack.config.js** file.  

You can change the port whatever you want(in our case, we have set the default port to **3000**), if its conflicting with other projects on your system. Now hit the link **http://localhost:3000** on browser.  

Whenever you save any file after changes(in development mode), it will automatically restart the server and reload the browser as because we are running the server with hot deployment.
